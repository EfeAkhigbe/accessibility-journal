# Journal Entry 6: Accessibility for Everyone (Chapter 2 - Disabilities and Impairment) 

> An estimated 37,627,800 people in the US—12.1% of the population—have a disability. In the UK, 16% of working-age adults have a disability, amounting to over 11 million people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines the word **disability** as follows:

> _Disabilities is an umbrella term, covering impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. An impairment is a problem in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; while a participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations._

The author notes that this definition is tricky because impairments come in various forms and intensities. She also explains how individuals may have multiple impairments that, when combined, can significantly affect their ability to use the internet.

Another interesting point was the language choice used in the US and UK. Rather than saying *“Sam is disabled,”* the preferred term is *“Sam has a disability.”* The author chooses this phrasing because it emphasizes the person first, fostering a mindset that promotes universal design.

## Five Types of Disabilities That Impede Web Use

- Visual impairments  
- Auditory impairments  
- Motor impairments  
- Cognitive impairments  
- Vestibular disorders and seizures  

### Visual Impairments

#### Color Blindness

> _Color blindness is a common visual impairment that affects up to 8% of men and 0.5% of women._

I learned a new word from this book: **Trichromacy** – this is when normal color vision uses all three light cones in our eyes.

I also learned about the different types of color blindness:

- **Deuteranopia**  
- **Protanopia**  
- People with both deuteranopia and protanopia are known as **red-green color blind**  
- **Tritanopia**  
- **Monochromacy**

#### Eyesight Loss

- Age-related macular degeneration  
- Glaucoma  
- Diabetic retinopathy

### Auditory Impairments

- Conductive hearing loss  
- Sensorineural hearing loss  

I found this quote below quite astonishing:

> _American Sign Language (ASL) and British Sign Language (BSL) differ from each other much more than spoken US English and British English do._
