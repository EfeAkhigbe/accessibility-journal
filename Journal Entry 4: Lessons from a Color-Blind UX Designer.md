# Journal Entry 4: Lessons from a Color-Blind UX Designer

---

This [article](https://medium.com/@christian.hartvig/what-colour-blind-designers-can-teach-us-about-seeing-differently-the-hidden-advantage-5cd053bca5fe) was written by a color-blind UX designer. You can imagine my surprise when I read that part but as I continued, I discovered that his color blindness had become his superpower. It enabled him to create designs that didn’t rely heavily on color but instead focused on structure, spacing, contrast, and clarity.

Here are some key takeaways from the article:
  
- **Always test designs with real users**, because software tools are not always reliable. The author shared an experience where a colleague asked for feedback on a design. Although the design had passed accessibility checks using software, the author, being color-blind was unable to interpret key elements, proving that tools can miss important nuances. **You can simulate color blindness using software tools, but nothing beats real human feedback.** Testing with actual users reveals challenges that tools may overlook.  
- **Designing for the average user often means designing for no one in particular.** Start with edge cases. This approach benefits everyone. A great example is the curb cut. It was designed for wheelchair users but is now helpful for people pushing strollers, rolling suitcases, or walking with small children.  
- **Focus on what truly matters** Hierarchy, contrast, function, form, and spacing. **Don’t rely on color alone.**
- **In Scandinavia, 10–11% of men are color-blind** [Source](https://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/)

The author closed with a powerful quote:

> “Design isn’t about seeing all the colors. It’s about seeing what matters.”
