# Journal Entry 3: Accessible Interface Design

---

This [article](https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/accessible-interface-design-d80e95cbb2c1) discusses a design aspect I'm passionate about, color contrast. It’s a topic I explored so deeply that I won a case study challenge centered on it which inspired the creation of an accessible color generator I named “AccessPalette ”

The author of the article shared how he often chooses colors based on personal preference, only to find out later during accessibility checks that the colors don’t meet the Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG). This forces him to go back to the beginning of the color selection process.

This is an issue I’ve faced a couple of times while designing. As a result, I’ve embraced the habit of testing colors with a contrast checker before finalizing a project’s color palette.

The article introduces [ColorSafe](http://colorsafe.co/), a tool that suggests accessible color palettes. However, this tool has some limitations for instance, it doesn’t offer a real-time preview of how text and background color combinations will actually look.

When I conceptualized AccessPalette, I hadn’t even heard of [ColorSafe](http://colorsafe.co/). I only discovered it near the end of my case study, when I decided to search the internet for similar tools. Finding ColorSafe validated the need for a tool like AccessPalette to exist in the market.

AccessPalette is a tool that generates accessible color suggestions based on WCAG standards. But it goes beyond what [ColorSafe](http://colorsafe.co/) offers. In addition to recommending compliant colors, AccessPalette also:

- Provides real-time visualization of color combinations  
- Displays detailed WCAG validation results  
- Supports multiple color formats, including HSL, RGB, and CMYK  

I’m currently building AccessPalette and plan to launch it before the end of the year. I believe it will be a valuable tool for designers and will help create accessible designs that everyone can use.
