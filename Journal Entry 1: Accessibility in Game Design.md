# Journal Entry 1: Accessibility in Game Design

_For my first journal entry, I read a few pages from the **JACCES Journal of Accessibility and Design for All** (Volume 14 - Issue 2, 2024)._

## Audio Accessibility Challenges in Games

I discovered the challenges game developers face when trying to add audio accessibility features to games. Some developers even give up on the idea because of the difficulties involved.

One example discussed was how sound cues are often used in games:
- **Footsteps** to indicate the arrival of an enemy.
- **Gunshots** to alert the player of an attack.

But how can developers portray these scenarios to people with poor hearing?

Although **haptics** and **other sound modalities** can help, they’re not always enough. Still, it’s gratifying to know that **game companies aren’t giving up**. Many are actively upgrading their games to be more inclusive. Some even make **special announcements** to highlight their accessibility features — and that is truly applaudable. More companies should follow in their footsteps.

## Using Symbols to Represent Colors

Another thing I learned from the journal is that **colors can also be represented by specific symbols** to help people who can’t differentiate between them. This is a **fantastic move**, and honestly, I had never heard of this method until now.

## Combining Multiple Accessibility Features

What fascinated me most was how **multiple accessibility features are combined** to enhance game experiences. For instance:
- A **declining enemy** can be shown using:
  - A **declining health bar** beside or above them.
  - **Haptic feedback** to reflect weaker enemy attacks.
  - **Visual cues** like groans or grunts to give more context.

This thoughtful layering of accessibility makes games more inclusive and enjoyable for everyone.
