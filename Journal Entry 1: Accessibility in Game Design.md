# Journal Entry 1: Accessibility in Game Design

_For my first journal entry, I read a few pages from the **JACCES Journal of Accessibility and Design for All** (Volume 14 - Issue 2, 2024)._

This journal explained the challenges game developers face when implementing accessibility features in games. Some developers even give up on the idea because of the difficulties involved. For example, it explained a scenario in a game where footsteps and gunshot sounds alert the gamer to enemy activity. This raises the question: how can developers effectively convey such scenarios to those with hearing impairments? Although haptics and other sound modalities contribute to the experience, they are insufficient.  It is gratifying to know that game companies are not giving up on this and are constantly upgrading their games to accommodate everyone. Some game companies go as far as to give special announcements of their accessibility features. This is applaudable and other companies should follow in their footsteps. 

Another thing I learnt from the journal is that specific symbols can be represented with colours to assist people who have difficulty distinguishing between colours. This is a fantastic approach that I hadn't heard of until now.

One fascinating aspect I learnt about is how video games incorporate accessibility features to enhance the game experience. For instance, a dying enemy can be depicted with a decreasing health bar displayed at the side of the screen or directly above the enemy's head. Additionally, haptic feedback can indicate a reduced intensity of the enemy's attacks, while cues such as groans or grunts help players better understand the characters in the game.

The gaming industry has made progress in incorporating accessibility features into games, but there is still a long way to go. With the emergence of new technologies and artificial intelligence, we are closer to a future where everyone can enjoy the gaming experience regardless of abilities.
