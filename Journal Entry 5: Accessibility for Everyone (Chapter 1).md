# Journal Entry 5: Accessibility for Everyone (Chapter 1)

I'm currently reading this book ‚Äî [**Accessibility for Everyone** by Laura Kalbag](https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone) ‚Äî and that will be the subject of this journal for the next few days.

## Busting Myths About Accessibility

In the first chapter, the author busts several myths about accessibility:

1. **Accessibility is boring**  
   This is a common misconception. I've heard people say this over and over again. But it's a big lie, what‚Äôs the use of a shiny, trendy page that half of your users can‚Äôt even use?  
   The author emphasizes how we often focus on using the shiniest tools and trends, sacrificing what really matters: usability and inclusion.

2. **We can‚Äôt tell if everyone benefits**  
   Many people assume individuals with disabilities don‚Äôt use the web, so they design only for the users they think are online. The truth is, when we put accessibility front and center, everyone benefits.

3. **We don‚Äôt know what to do**  
   That‚Äôs not an excuse. There are plenty of articles, resources, and books like this one-that teach accessibility.

4. **It's hard and theres's too much work to do**  
   The author doesn‚Äôt claim accessibility is simple. But she reminds us that we overcome bugs and technical complexities every day. We can do the same with accessibility.

> _‚ÄúIt‚Äôs even good for business: by making our sites accessible for everyone, we also increase our potential user base.‚Äù_

## Defining Accessibility

I really love how the author defines accessibility:

> _‚ÄúAccessibility in the physical world is the degree to which an environment is usable by as many people as possible. Web accessibility is the degree to which a website is usable by as many people as possible. We can think about both kinds of accessibility as forms of inclusion.‚Äù_

## Accessibility in Our Environment

1. **Pivoting door knobs instead of spherical ones**  
   These help people with reduced hand mobility open doors easily. I remember times I used my elbow to open my door while carrying a hot pot of water.  
   Imagine if it had been a spherical knob, I would‚Äôve had to put the pot down, twist the knob, pick it up again, and repeat that whole process just to close the door. üòÇ Funny and very stressful.

2. **Traffic signals that play sounds** to alert visually impaired individuals when it‚Äôs safe to cross.

3. **Subtitles in movies** to support people who are hard of hearing.

4. **Simple signage** to help people with reading difficulties navigate public spaces.

> _‚ÄúIn many countries, public spaces must be inclusive by law. Excluding a person from a non-accessible public space through design is discriminatory and, therefore, illegal.‚Äù_

## Universal Design

Ronald L. Mace coined the term **Universal Design**. He contracted polio at age nine and used a wheelchair for the rest of his life.

> _‚ÄúUniversal design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.‚Äù_

Wow. I love this definition. It means accessible design should be incorporated so seamlessly that it doesn‚Äôt even stand out, it just fits.  
Take curb cuts, for example. I had seen them before and even used them but never paid attention until I learned they were originally meant for wheelchair users.

## Accessible Design vs. Universal Design

- **Accessible design** considers people with disabilities, but it‚Äôs sometimes an afterthought. For example, placing a wheelchair ramp on the far side of a building, separating users.
- **Universal design** considers the needs of diverse people from the start, like building stairs and a wheelchair ramp side by side, so everyone shares the same entry point.

> _‚ÄúWhereas accessible design creates products that are usable by those with disabilities, universal design creates products for the widest possible audience, which includes, but isn‚Äôt limited to, people with disabilities.‚Äù_

> _‚ÄúUniversal web accessibility helps us create sites that are usable by the widest, most diverse audience, rather than creating bolt-on solutions that might benefit one group at the expense of another.‚Äù_

## Empathy in Design

The author emphasizes that empathy plays a big role in how we design. When we can empathize with our users, we create better, more inclusive solutions. Having a diverse team helps too.

## Screen Readers

The author walks us through various screen readers:

- **Job Access With Speech (JAWS)**: Optimized for Windows  
- **VoiceOver**: Made by Apple for Apple devices
- **Window-Eyes**: For Windows devices
- **Narrator**: By Microsoft
- **Open source screen readers**: NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) for Windows, Linux Screen Reader (LSR), and Orca for Linux.

She also points out that screen readers aren‚Äôt just for people with visual impairments, they‚Äôre also useful for anyone who prefers listening to content, like audiobook lovers or people driving.

## Keyboard Navigation

Almost everyone benefits from keyboard navigation, from users with faulty mice to programmers working in text-based consoles. It‚Äôs a simple but powerful accessibility feature.

## Beyond Screen Readers

Screen readers aren‚Äôt the only assistive technologies out there. Here are more:

### 1. Navigation Hardware  
- Switch input  
- Eye trackers  

### 2. Speech Recognition  

### 3. Screen Magnifiers  
There are two main types:  
- **Picture-in-picture** magnification  
- **Full-screen** magnification
